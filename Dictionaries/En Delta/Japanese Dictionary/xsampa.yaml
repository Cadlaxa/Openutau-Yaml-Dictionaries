#Dictionary extension for En-Delta/X-sampa voicebanks
#Japanese (Hiragana, Katakana, romaji), Korean (Hangul, Romaja), Chinese Pinyin, and French are currently supported.
#More languages to support soon.
#This dictionary is being updated regularly so download the latest one here:
#https://github.com/Cadlaxa/Openutau-Yaml-Dictionaries.git

#phoneme [ao] is converted as [o], if the vb has problems on the pronunciation, change it to [O/Q]
#steps in changing a phoneme: use notepad, find this types of config (X = will be your phoneme here)
#and type the configs without the parenthesis on find then, replace it with your desired phoneme
#([X,) (, X,) (,X])

#phoneme [q] or glottal stop on arpasing might be an issue to the vb, inputs such as [kk a] have
#glottal input (q, k, A), manually type the desired phoneme on OU then lengthen the VC/CC to emulate a stop/glottal
