# Openutau-Yaml-Dictionaries
Openutau Yaml Dictionaries for Arpasing, En VCCV, and Delta phonemizers to support Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and French (more languages to support soon)

`English to Japanese`, `English to Korean`, `English to Chinese`, and `English to French` (languages auxiliary support for now) for Arpasing, En VCCV, and Delta banks for [Openutau](https://www.openutau.com/) .yaml dictionaries, tweacked based on [Slidingwall's synth dictionary](https://github.com/Slidingwall/synthv-dictionaries).

#### üìç As of now, the bigger the `.yaml` file, the slower Openutau changes the phonemes or any changes in general, as of Ou doesn't support yet the dictionary picking like on Synthv, for now, you can choose and download the single language dictionary or the compiled one.

if there's any issue, and language request to support Openutau's dictionary, you can contact me through my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cadlaxa).

#### üìç There may be wrong entries and mispronunciation in the dictionary, please report them if so. Making your english voicebanks sings in different languages will still require phoneme editing as this lexicon is by no means a plug-and-play solution especially Korean, Chinese, and the French one.

‚≠ê The dictionaries are updated regularly so feel free to download the latest one [here]()or in this [mirror link](https://mega.nz/folder/BjhATYZb#s3dYIDZxlBRG7TF0QBG6Xw). ‚≠ê

-  Open SynthV and load the voice you want to use with the dictionary you downloaded. In the `Dictionary`panel, click on `New...` and then name the dictionary with the same name as the .json file (`CHN2FRA`, `ENG2FRA`, `JPN2FRA` or `ANY2FRA`). Make sure the language and phonemes match with your dictionary. The `ANY2FRA` dictionary can be used with any language or phonemes.

## How to add a word

If you want to add a word to the dictionary, please add it to the [Open Utau Dictionary](https://github.com/mmemim/OpenUTAU-French-Dictionary#how-to-add-a-word). You can also request words to be added [here](https://github.com/mmemim/SynthV-FrenchDictionary/issues/1).

## How to use the dictionary

You can type a word in French and split it in syllables with `+`. Because of the way Synth V handles syllables in Chinese, you'll have to add additional splits for CCs as shown below.

![WordSplitting](https://i.imgur.com/QoQ5RSi.png)

If you want to say words like `l'ann√©e` or `j'en` you'll have to split them in two notes `l'` + `ann√©e` and `j'` + `en` as shown below.

![WordCombination](https://i.imgur.com/6zxP6SR.png)

In French, you also have [liaisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_(French)), and some words might not always be pronounced the same way. Because of that, you may sometimes need to put `word(2)`, `word(3)` or even `word(4)`. For example, `absentes` has 4 entries.

With the ANY2FRA dictionary, you can switch between Chinese, English & Japanese phonemes. You just need to add `*` for Japanese or `$` for English.
