# Openutau-Yaml-Dictionaries
Openutau Yaml Dictionaries for Arpasing, En VCCV, and Delta phonemizers to support Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and French (more languages to support soon)

`English to Japanese`, `English to Korean`, `English to Chinese`, and `English to French` (languages auxiliary support for now) for Arpasing, En VCCV, and Delta banks for [Openutau](https://www.openutau.com/) .yaml dictionaries, tweacked based on [Slidingwall's synth dictionary](https://github.com/Slidingwall/synthv-dictionaries).

#### üìç As of now, the bigger the `.yaml` file, the slower Openutau changes the phonemes or any changes in general, as of Ou doesn't support yet the dictionary picking like on Synthv, for now, you can choose and download the single language dictionary or the compiled one.

- if there's any issue, and language request to support Openutau's dictionary, you can contact me through my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cadlaxa).

#### üìç There may be wrong entries and mispronunciation in the dictionary, please report them if so. Making your english voicebanks sings in different languages will still require phoneme editing as this lexicon is by no means a plug-and-play solution especially Korean, Chinese, and the French one.

‚≠ê The dictionaries are updated regularly so feel free to download the latest one [here]()or in this [mirror link](https://mega.nz/folder/BjhATYZb#s3dYIDZxlBRG7TF0QBG6Xw). ‚≠ê

## How to use the dictionary + the suffix support

### Japanese Dictionary Usage
- You can input `Hiragana`, `Katakana` and `romaji c v` in the notes to utilize the japanese dictionary. It also supports the usage of `„Å£` eg: `„Å£„Å∞`, `„Å£„ÅÑ„Åá`, `„Å£„Åó„Çá` and glottal stops on vowels eg: `„ÅÇ2`, `„ÅÑ2`, `„ÅÜ2`, `„Åà2`, `„Åä2`, `„Çì2`

### Korean Dictionary Usage
- You can input `Hanguul` and `Romaja` with `.` after the romaja word in the notes to utilize the Korean dictionary. Some have alternate pronunciations by inputing `1`, `2`, and `3` after the word. **Note that korean consonant assimilation is not supported because of the complex character-to-phoneme system with the `Hangul` input, so using `Romaja` to place consonants such as `ss.`, `p.`, `bb.` and so on the note.**

### French Dictionary Usage
- You can input `French`, with `*` after the word in the notes to utilize the French dictionary. Based with [mmemim's](https://github.com/mmemim) [Synthv French .json Dictionary](https://github.com/mmemim/OpenUTAU-French-Dictionary), If you want to say words like l'ann√©e or j'en you'll have to split them in two notes l' + ann√©e and j' + en as shown below.

- In French, you also have [liaisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaison_(French)), and some words might not always be pronounced the same way. Because of that, you may sometimes need to put `word(2)`, `word(3)` or even `word(4)`. For example, `absentes` has 4 entries.

## How to edit dictionary to fit a specific voicebank
- Some voicebanks come with extra phonemes especially with En VCCV and Delta voicebanks, test out first the dictionary so you will know if its there are errors you will encounter like on this picture below:
![example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92255161/216491969-82eb325e-9077-423d-97c6-2ab73f5b1caa.png)

- Editing the `.yaml` file via notepad or any other editing software you have to edit your desired phoneme per voicebank. I recommended to copy first one language then edit with the instructions inside the `.yaml` file
